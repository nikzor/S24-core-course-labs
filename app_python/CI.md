## Best Practices Implemented:

1. Automated Testing: Running automated tests ensures that code changes do not introduce regressions. Here, the workflow executes unit tests using pytest.
2. Code Linting: Utilizing tools like `flake8` for code linting ensures consistent code style and identifies potential issues early in the development process.
3. Dependency Management: Caching dependencies based on the `requirements.txt` file optimizes build times by reusing previously installed dependencies when possible.
4. Security Scanning: Integration with Snyk enables continuous security testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
5. Docker Image Management: Docker is used to containerize the application, and Docker Hub is utilized for image storage and distribution. Docker login and image tagging/pushing steps are automated.
