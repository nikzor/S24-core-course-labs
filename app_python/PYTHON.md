# Lab 1: Web Application Development

### Best practices, applied in application:

1. The application follows a standard Flask structure with a clear separation of concerns, separating the application logic `app.py` from the presentation layer `templates/index.html`
2. Followed PEP8 standards for clean and readable code, use PyCharm linter to check errors and warnings in the code
3. Maintained a **`requirements.txt`** file listing all necessary libraries for the application
4. Created virtual environment for convenient work with dependencies
